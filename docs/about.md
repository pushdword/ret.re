 I'm a security professional in vulnerability research, management and also security testing.
This website is an attempt to expose what I do on non-labour hours and I hope motivate others to follow this awesome IT field.
Note that I'm not an expert.
Ideally I want to show my ultra mega virtualization project for red teaming (single attack vectors testing, not full assessments), vulnerability research (by fuzzing methods) and others.
